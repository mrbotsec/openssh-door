OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol. It encrypts all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. In addition, OpenSSH provides a large suite of secure tunneling capabilities, several authentication methods, and sophisticated configuration options.

The OpenSSH suite consists of the following tools:

Remote operations are done using ssh, scp, and sftp.
Key management with ssh-add, ssh-keysign, ssh-keyscan, and ssh-keygen.
The service side consists of sshd, sftp-server, and ssh-agent.
OpenSSH is developed by a few developers of the OpenBSD Project and made available under a BSD-style license.

OpenSSH is incorporated into many commercial products, but very few of those companies assist OpenSSH with funding.

Contributions towards OpenSSH can be sent to the OpenBSD Foundation.
